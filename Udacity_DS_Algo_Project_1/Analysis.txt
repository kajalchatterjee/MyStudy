Step 3 - Calculate Big O

Task 0:
Exceution time is constant irresepective size of the input.
find first record:  O(1)
find last record:  O(1)

Task 1:
Execution time grows as size of the input grows
O(n)


Task 2:
Execution time grows as size of the input grows
O(n)

Task 3:
Execution time grows as size of the input grows
Part A: O(n)
Part B: O(n)

Task 4:
Execution time grows as size of the input grows
O(n)
